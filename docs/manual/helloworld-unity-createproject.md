# Creating a new Unity project

Go to the Unity [archive page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) and download the latest 2018.3.x version or 2019.1.x version. Other versions might work, but are not officially supported.

Create a new Unity project by selecting the 3D Template and choosing a project name and location. Unity will create several folders at that location, the most important of which is the `Assets` folder. This contains all source files for the project, and this is where the MixedReality-WebRTC Unity integration will be installed.
