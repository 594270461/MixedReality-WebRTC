# Establishing a connection

Now that we have a both local and remote video players, we can attempt to establish a connection with a remote peer.

There are a few requirements for this:

- We need 2 instances of the application running at the same time. Unfortunately the Unity Editor cannot be opened twice with the same project. As a workaround, we can build and deploy the app on a device, even locally on the developer machine. Alternatively, we can use a second computer running another instance of the Unity Editor with an exact copy of this Unity project. The later is easier because we can still modify the project.
- The `NodeDssSignaler` component needs to be configured to know which remote peer to expect. This is due to the fact that this is a simple, easy, and **not production-ready** solution which does not offer any functionality to discover and select a remote peer. Instead it uses strings to identify the two peers. We can chose any two different string.

## Configuring the `NodeDssSignaler`

The [`NodeDssSignaler`](xref:Microsoft.MixedReality.WebRTC.Unity.NodeDssSignaler) has a **Remote Peer Id** property which contains the string identifying the remote peer to connect with. This should be filled with the identifier of the remote peer. The easiest way to obtain this identifier is to press **Play** and wait for the local signaler to start polling our `node-dss` server. If the server was started with the `DEBUG=*dss` environment variable set, it will output for each web request a message containing the identifier of the peer.

- Download and install `Node.js` from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Clone the `node-dss` repository : `git clone https://github.com/bengreenier/node-dss.git`
- Configure and run it:

```
cd node-dss
set DEBUG=dss*
npm install
npm start
```

The `node-dss` server should start in a new shell window and wait for incoming connections. At this point we can press **Play** in the Unity Editor to start polling the `node-dss` server, and retrieve from the shell terminal its identifier string:

This string needs to be pasted into the **Remote Peer Id** property of the _remote_ peer on the other machine. Repeat the process on the remote machine and paste the result on the **Remote Peer Id** property of the local machine.

> [!Warning]
> This step is critical, and there is no safeguard. If any of the two signalers doesn't have the correct value for the identifier of the remote peer then the peer connection will not be established.
