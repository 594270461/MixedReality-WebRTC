# MixedReality-WebRTC build pipeline for Release
# Build the core WebRTC implementation and the UWP wrappers

# Disable branch and PR triggers, the core implementation only changes
# when upgrading to a more recent version from Google, which is quite
# infrequent. Also this pipeline is very long (several hours) so should
# be triggered manually only when needed.
trigger: none
pr: none

# Give a unique name to the build each time it runs
name: release-core-$(SourceBranchName)-$(Date:yyyyMMdd)-$(Rev:r)
